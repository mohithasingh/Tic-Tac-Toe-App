Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game where Player 1 marks "X" and Player 2 marks "O" on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to form three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal (both positive and negative). If a player achieves this, they win. If the grid is completely filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

This game has been developed using **Java** in **Android Studio**. The first screen displays the title *"Tic-Tac-Toe"* along with a "Play" button to start the game. Clicking it navigates users to a page where they enter their names and submit them before proceeding to the game board.

The gameplay alternates between players, indicating whose turn it is. Player 1 places "X" while Player 2 places "O" on the board. The winnerâ€™s name is displayed at the top when the game ends. If there is no winner, the message *"Match Tied"* appears. Players can either select *"Play Again"* to reset the board and continue with the same names or choose *"Home"* to return to the main screen and start over.
